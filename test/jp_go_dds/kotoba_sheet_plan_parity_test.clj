(ns jp-go-dds.kotoba-sheet-plan-parity-test
  "W6 slice for jp-go-dds: which stylesheets make up a page, in what order.

  `jp-go-dds.css/css-for` is one decision wrapped in one effect — pick the
  components `dds.css` does not already bundle, keep the caller's order, put
  `global.css` first when asked, then read those files and join them with a
  newline. `kotoba/sheet_plan.kotoba` owns the first three; the fourth stays
  in `.cljc`, where the I/O already lives.

  The gate does not compare plans to plans. It resolves the guest's plan with
  the host's own `slurp` and requires the bytes to equal what `css-for`
  returns for the same request, over the real vendored catalogue — so a
  different set, a different order, or a lost de-duplication shows up as a
  byte difference in the sheet a page would actually ship.

  Consumer APIs are unchanged; `jp-go-dds.css` remains what callers require,
  and `kotoba-lang/compiler` is a test-only dep."
