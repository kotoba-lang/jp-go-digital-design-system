  "W6 slice 2 for jp-go-dds: the dark ramp mirror as a Kotoba rule.

  `jp-go-dds.dark` derives a dark palette by walking each upstream ramp
  backwards — one rule, `i → n-1-i`, applied uniformly so that no ramp needs an
  exception table. `kotoba/dark_mirror.kotoba` owns that rule; this gate runs it
  against every ramp actually present in the vendored `dds.css` and requires it
  to agree with `dark/mirror` step for step.

  Scanning the stylesheet stays in `.cljc` — see the module header. The input
  here is what the scan produced, not the stylesheet.

  Consumer APIs are unchanged; `kotoba-lang/compiler` is a test-only dep."
