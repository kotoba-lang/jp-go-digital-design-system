  "What keeps the shipped artifacts honest, now that they are what runs.

  Every `*-parity-test` in this repository compiles a `.kotoba` fresh and
  compares it to the `.cljc`. That was the whole check while the host had its
  own copy of every rule. It is not the whole check any more, because on the
  JVM the host no longer computes them — it reads
  `resources/jp_go_dds/oracle/*.kir.edn`, and a fresh compile is not those
  files. Three things have to hold that did not have to before:

    1. the shipped artifact IS the current source, compiled;
    2. the host actually reads it, rather than having quietly kept a copy;
    3. the ClojureScript path, which is NOT delegated, still agrees with it.

  The second is the one that is easy to lose and impossible to see. A
  delegation that fell back to a host implementation would pass every parity
  test ever written, because a host copy is exactly what those tests compare
  against. So this asks the only question that separates them — swap in a core
  that answers differently and see whether the host follows.

  The third exists because this library is the base design system of the
  workspace and ~170 repositories depend on it, most of them building for
  ClojureScript, where there is no classpath and `kotoba.kir` is not on the
  path. `jp-go-dds.kotoba-oracle` is therefore `.clj` and the `:cljs` branches
  still compute. Those branches are a second implementation, and rather than
  leave them checked by nothing, `the-cljs-fallback-agrees-with-the-shipped-core`
  runs them against the guest directly."

(defn- renumber-gensyms
  "Rewrite compiler-generated names to a per-artifact counter.

  Compiled KIR can carry gensyms — `and` and `or` lower to a `let` over
  `or-tmp__11099` — and the suffix comes from a JVM-wide counter, so it differs
  between the run that produced an artifact and the run comparing against it.
  Where that happens a raw `=` fails ALWAYS, which is the same as not checking.
  Renumbering in encounter order keeps the check exact about structure while
  ignoring the one thing that is legitimately not reproducible.

  **Measured 2026-08-12: none of this repository's eight cores contains a
  single gensym**, because they are written in nested `if` rather than `and` /
  `or`. So today this function is the identity, and
  `the-gensym-normalizer-is-not-masking-anything-today` says so out loud. It is
  kept rather than deleted because the first core to use `and` would otherwise
  turn the drift gate red for a reason that has nothing to do with drift — but
  a normalizer nobody has measured is also how a real difference gets
  swallowed, so the fact that it currently collapses NOTHING is asserted rather
  than assumed."
