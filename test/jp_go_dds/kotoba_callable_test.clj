  "Every core ships a callable surface, not only a compilable one.

  Each `*-parity-test` reaches its module by appending zero-arg case defns and
  compiling again. That is fine for a test and impossible for a caller, and
  until 2026-08-12 it was the only way in: the modules declared no `:export`,
  and a comment in each named the harness as the reason.

  The harness was not the reason. A `:document` crosses the KIR entry boundary
  in both directions, host-built, with a wrong tag refused rather than coerced
  (`kotoba-dark-mirror-parity-test`). What refused an export list was `main`,
  which a declared list must contain, and `ir/execute` running exported
  functions only, which the harness answers by widening the list with its own
  case names.

  So this asks each module, in the shape it ships, the two questions the parity
  tests structurally cannot: does it compile without a harness, and does the
  export list mean anything."
