  "W6 slice 3 for jp-go-dds: the dark / light / snapshot declarations, over
  declared palette data.

  Slice 2 recorded that the CSS scan could not move to Kotoba, because
  recovering structure from text with a regex is a design change before it is a
  migration. This slice makes that change: `scripts/palette.cljs` runs the scan
  once at vendor time and writes `resources/jp_go_dds/palette.edn`, and
  `kotoba/dark_declarations.kotoba` decides over the result.

  Three things are checked here:

  1. the committed `palette.edn` still agrees with what the library's scan
     returns today — a re-vendor without regenerating it fails;
  2. the guest's dark / light / snapshot values agree with `jp-go-dds.dark`
     for every ramp in the vendored sheet;
  3. the assumptions the port relies on hold in the real data — every scrim is
     spelled `rgba(0, 0, 0, …)`, and white/black are outside the ramps.

  Consumer APIs are unchanged; `kotoba-lang/compiler` is a test-only dep."
