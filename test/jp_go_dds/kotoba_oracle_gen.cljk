      clojure -M:test:gen

  Runs under :test because the compiler lives there and must not reach the
  library -- a consumer needs to EXECUTE KIR, not to produce it. What this
  writes IS what a consumer loads, so nothing here transforms it: the same
  compile call as the drift test, pretty-printed EDN, no post-processing. If
  this file and that test disagreed about how to compile, the test would be
  checking something other than what ships."
