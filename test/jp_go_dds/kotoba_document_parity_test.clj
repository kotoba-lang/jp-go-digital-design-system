(ns jp-go-dds.kotoba-document-parity-test
  "W6 next-cohort slice for jp-go-dds: the `--hig-*` → DADS bridge as a logical
  `:document` value.

  `kotoba/bridge_document.kotoba` must byte-agree with `jp-go-dds.tokens`:
  the same 71-entry bridge renders to the same `:root { … }` stream, the same
  brand exclusion renders to the same stream, the same tokens normalize to the
  same custom-property names, and the same tokens answer `bridged?`.

  It must also fail closed where css.core throws: a value carrying `{ } ;` or
  `/*` is rejected as an `[:result :string :string]` error rather than spliced
  into the sheet. Kotoba has no `throw` — that is an intentional security
  constraint, not a backend gap — so the guest returns the failure as a value.

  The bridge is fed in chunks of at most `document-container-item-limit` (32)
  entries because it does not fit in one document value; see the module header.
  Joining chunks must leave no trace, which is itself asserted here.

  Consumer APIs are unchanged; `jp-go-dds.tokens` remains what 170 repos
  require. This gate is what keeps a second derivation of the token contract
  from drifting away from it."
